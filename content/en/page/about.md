# Vincent Archambault

I live in Montreal and I am a PhD student in computer science at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/). I previously worked for the French bank [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en/) and lived in France for 7 years.

I like to be active, travel, meditate and spend time with my family and friends. I practice among other things running, taekwondo and cross-country skiing.
